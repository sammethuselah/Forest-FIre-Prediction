# Forest-Fire-Prediction
Forest fire is also called as wild fire or wildland fire is an uncontrolled fire
occurring in forest areas. A Large destructive fire that spread over a forest or area
of woodland which leads to damage in Wildlife, humans, property and
Environment. It is essential to distinguish these sorts of flames as ahead of
schedule as conceivable in order to keep the harm away from the biological
framework. To combat forest fires effectively their early detection and continuous
tracking is vital. This project presents one of the methods for early wild fire
identification using the datasets available and the current data to predict and
prevent its spread. Objective is to classify the occurrence of forest fire based on
the intensity and use fuzzy logic to express the chance of occurrence of forest fire
in percentage.
